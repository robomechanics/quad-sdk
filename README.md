## Overview

Quad-SDK is an open source, ROS-based full stack software framework for agile quadrupedal locomotion. The design of Quad-SDK is focused on the vertical integration of planning, control, estimation, communication, and development tools which enable agile quadrupedal locomotion in simulation and hardware with minimal user changes for multiple platforms. The modular software architecture allows researchers to experiment with their own implementations of different components while leveraging the existing framework. Quad-SDK also offers Gazebo simulation support and a suite of visualization and data-processing tools for rapid development. Refer to the [paper] for high-level details of the framework.

## Installation

Refer to the [Quad-SDK Wiki](https://github.com/robomechanics/quad-sdk/wiki/1.-Getting-Started-with-Quad-SDK) for installation, dependency, and unit testing information. Currently Quad-SDK requires ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04. All other dependencies are installed with the included setup script.

## Usage

Launch the simulation with:

```
roslaunch quad_utils quad_gazebo.launch
```

Stand the robot with:
```
rostopic pub /robot_1/control/mode std_msgs/UInt8 "data: 1"
```
Run the stack with twist input:
```
roslaunch quad_utils quad_plan.launch reference:=twist logging:=true
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=/robot_1/cmd_vel
```
Run the stack with global planner:
```
roslaunch quad_utils quad_plan.launch reference:=gbpl logging:=true
```
Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/robomechanics/quad-sdk/wiki/2.-Using-the-Software) for more information on alternate usage.

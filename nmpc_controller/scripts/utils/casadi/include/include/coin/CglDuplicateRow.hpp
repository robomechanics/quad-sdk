      This is a very simple minded idea but I (JJF) am using it in a project so thought
      I might as well add it.  It should really be called before first solve and I may
      modify CBC to allow for that.

      This is designed for problems with few rows and many integer variables where the rhs
      are <= or == and all coefficients and rhs are small integers.

      If effective rhs is K then we can fix all variables with coefficients > K to their lower bounds
      (effective rhs just means original with variables with nonzero lower bounds subtracted out).

      If one row is a subset of another and the effective rhs are same we can fix some variables
      and then the two rows are identical.

      The generator marks identical rows so can be taken out in solve
